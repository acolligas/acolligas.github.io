        <section id="graphic"><h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        
        
        <h3>A Portrait in Adobe Illustrator</h3>
        <p>I created this portrait of my brother in Graphic Design 2. I was a sophomore at the time and beginning to do more advanced projects in Adobe Illustrator. This was an individual assignment so I was able to learn new things on my own and problem solve without the help of others. Something I took from this project was the importance of using and organizing/naming layers in a big project.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/anthony.png" style="width: 22%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: .3em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>Coloring a Black and White Image</h3>
        <p>This is another project I completed in Graphic Design 2. We were tasked with finding an image in black and white online and adding color. We were beginning to use Adobe Photoshop at the time so it helped with the different tools in that program. This helped me a lot with making selections in Photoshop and creating adjustment layers.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h3>A Sweet Sixteen Invitation</h3>
        <p>Between my sophomore and junior year of high school, my friend's mom asked me to create an invitation for her birthday party. I used Adobe Illustrator to create it and I had a lot of fun incorporating all the aspects she wanted. I got to make and use the mason jars and cake as requested by her. For the rest of it all I knew was it should have a vintage and elegant vibe. This was my first time working for a client and it was a great learning experience.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/grace.PNG" style="width: 25%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: .3em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>The Camping Party</h3>
        <p>This is another birthday invitation I was asked to design. I made this during my junior year and decided to go with a style similar to the invitation shown above. The reason I went in this direction is in Graphic Design we learned about work being consistant and recognizable in the professional world of design. My client provided me with the party's theme and that she wanted mountains, trees, and plaid to be incorperated. I loved this project because I got to use my own creativity to make an invitation using the few requirements from my client.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/camping.PNG" style="width: 25%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: .3em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>The Generate Logo</h3>
        <p>In Graphic Design 3, we were assigned teams of 4 to start a design firm with. Our first task was to create a company name and a mission statement, then create multiple logos to eventually vote for. Within my group, we named our design firm Generate and our mission statement was "creativity that speaks to you". Based on these aspects, I created this logo which ended up being selcted to be used for our company.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/logo.PNG" style="width: 30%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: .3em; margin-top: 2em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>Generate: Business Card</h3>
        <p>After developing a name, mission statement, and logo for Generate we got to move on to creating other things companies need. I enjoyed creating the business card because I got to test different ways of incorperating my logo in a creative way that still looked profesional.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/card.PNG" style="width: 35%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: .3em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>Generate: Letterhead</h3>
        <p>Another thing we got the opportunity to design was a letterhead for our design firm. At first, it was hard to find a spot for everything without it looking messy and without too much white space. I really liked this assignment because it was my first time creating a letterhead design and I got to research other designs to help me with inspiration. My design was chosen by my group to be used by Generate and it is one of my favorite designs because The logo stands out, the required information is readable, and I found a creative way to not have awkward white space.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/letter.PNG" style="width: 25%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: .3em; margin-top: 2em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>Generate: Envelope</h3>
        <p>Lastly, we were tasked with making an envelope for our design firm to use. This was the most hard to design because envelopes are always so simple but I wanted mine to stand out without being too extra. The coolest and most challenging part about all of these creations for Generate was making sure they all looked similar to keep clients from confusion.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/envelope.PNG" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 4em; margin-top: 4em; margin-left: .3em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>A Fair Use Campaign: Poster 1</h3>
        <p>In Graphic Design 3, we continued to work within our design firms but this time we were assigned a campaign to support. My group had a campaign to spread knowledge about transformative works. We created foldables, a flyers, and posters- designed by me. In order to make sure our work was consistant we all used Swiss design as our style so our campaign would be recognizable. We chose Swiss design because it has a nice aesthetic and is clean but still has plenty of creative opportunities.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/black.PNG" style="width: 25%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: .3em; margin-top: 1em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>A Fair Use Campaign: Poster 2</h3>
        <p>Continuing to work within our design firms, we kept working together and individually to solidify our campaign. My group did a lot of research about transformative works in preparation. This is my second poster and I feel like it is the one that represents Swiss design the best. I added a little more information to this poster than the others because I wanted to give a couple facts that may intrigue people to look more into the rest of our campaign.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/red.PNG" style="width: 25%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-left: .3em;">
        <br>
        
        <h3>A Fair Use Campaign: Poster 3</h3>
        <p>Generate kept working together and individually to produce the best possible fair use campaign. My group continued research about transformative works in order to know exactly what we were talking about. This is my third poster and the one that is most aesthetically appealing. I wanted to keep it simple because less is more, but still creative in order to match up with our mission statement, creativity that speaks to you.</p>

        <h3>Adobe Illustrator Certification</h3>

        <h3>Winter Escape</h3>
        <p>In my junior year of high school- in Web Design 3- we were given a task of creating a website based on winter. We did more than just create a basic site; this time we wee learning how to make websites responsive for large, medium, and small screens. We were given tutorial videos to help us, but other than that it was a good experience for self-teaching. My website included a link to a winter blog, photoalbum, activities, and more.</p>
        <img src="../Colligas_Portfolio/images/winter.jpg"  style="width: 75%; height: 40%; float:center; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 4em; margin-right: .3em; margin-top: 1em;">
        <br>
        <h3>Quiz Maker</h3>
        <p>Another project during junior year was making a quiz on what we had learned in web so far that provided the correct answer and randomized the questions. In order to have a quiz provide results and random questions you have to use Javascript. This was a good project to start the year with because we got to refresh our minds on Javascript and learn new things at the same time.</p>

        <h3>Elevator Speech</h3>
        <p>In 9th grade, I took a class called Freshmen studies and we learned many valuable life skills. This project was called "Elevator Speech" because it was a short pitch we had to memorize and present to the class to get a point across. I chose to do mine on Disney because that is something that represents who I am and what I value as a student and as a person. Doing this prepared me for the rest of high school because since this I have felt confident and comfortable memorizing and speaking presentations to large groups.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>My Spanish House</h3>
        <p>For this PBL, we worked in teams of four to create and label a house that modeled one of a Spanish speaking country. My team chose to do and Argentine Rural Home. We had to do research on specific characteristics of these homes and incorporate at least three. After creating the house, we were required to label 100 items in Spanish. This PBL was to help us learn about the chapter in our Spanish textbook about household items and rooms in homes. It was very fun and it let people use their creativity and program areas to help make things. I learned a lot about Argentina's culture and Spanish words for household items.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Using a Microscope</h3>
        <p>For this project, our challenge was to find out all about the cells within our objects. We discovered where the cells of all different shapes, sizes, and colors were located. After that, we got to use computers and textbooks to find out what the cells' jobs are. My team chose to observe leaves from two plants, a grape seed, skin of a carrot, and a butterfly wing. I think we would have done better if we chose to do more bugs than plants. The butterfly wing was the most interesting. I believe this project was very educational because Mr. Goode helped us relate the cells of other organisms to our cells. Having the freedom to basically create our own project was interesting especially when we could make connections between our cells and the cells of other things</p>
